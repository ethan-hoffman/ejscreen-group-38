## Partner 1 - Section A.g. (Read in the CSV file and convert column headers to lower snake case).
```{r}
#Read in the ces3demographics.csb data as an object called ces.
ces <- read_csv(here("data", "ces3demographics.csv"))

#Convert column headers to lower_snake_case using the janitor package.
ces_clean <- ces %>% clean_names()
```

```{r}
# ggplot
ggplot(data = ces_clean, aes(x = white_percent, y = ces_3_0_score)) +
  geom_hex() +
  labs(x = "Percent White", y = "Pollution Burden Score", title = "Pollution Burden Score by Percent of White People in Neighborhood") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "navy", high = "orange") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The overall trend is that as the percent of white individuals increases in a neighborhood the pollution burden score decreases.  The trend appears to be negatively correlated.
